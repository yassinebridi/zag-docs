# Pin Input

The pin input is optimized for entering a sequence of digits or letters. The
input fields allow one character at a time. When the digit or letter is entered,
focus transfers to the next input in the sequence, until every input is filled.

<Showcase id="PinInput" />

**Features**

- Automatically focuses the next field on typing and focuses the previous field
  on deletion.
- Supports numeric and alphanumeric values.
- Support for masking value (for sensitive data).
- Support for copy/paste to autofill all fields.
- Supports fast paste SMS-code.

## Installation

To use the pin input machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="pin-input/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic pin input logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

Now you can use the pin input in your project!

```jsx
import * as pinInput from "@ui-machines/pin-input"
```

## Anatomy

To set up the pin input correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

On a high level, the pin input consists of:

- **Root**: The root container for the pin input.
- **Input**: The editable field for users to enter values.

## Usage

The pin input package exports two key functions:

- `machine` — The state machine logic for the pin input widget.
- `connect` — The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll need to provide a unique `id` to the `useSetup` hook. This is used to
> ensure that the every part has a unique identifier.

<CodeSnippet id="pin-input/usage.mdx" />

## Setting a default value

To set the initial value of the pin input, pass the `value` property to the
machine's context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  pinInput.machine.withContext({
    value: ["1", "2", ""],
  }),
)
```

## Changing the placeholder

To customize the default pin input placeholder (○) for each input, pass the
`placeholder` prop and set it to your desired value.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  pinInput.machine.withContext({
    placeholder: "*",
  }),
)
```

## Blur on complete

By default, the last input maintains focus when filled and we invoke the
`onComplete` callback. To blur the last input when the user completes the input,
set the `blurOnComplete: true` in the machine's context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  pinInput.machine.withContext({
    blurOnComplete: true,
  }),
)
```

## Allowing alphanumeric values

By default, the pin input accepts only number values but you can choose between
`numeric`, `alphanumeric` and `alphabetic` values. To change the input mode,
pass the `type` context property and set its value to `alphanumeric`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  pinInput.machine.withContext({
    type: "alphanumeric",
  }),
)
```

## Using OTP mode

To trigger smartphone OTC auto-suggestion, it is recommended to set the
`autocomplete` attribute to "one-time-code". The pin-input machine provides
support for this automatically when you set the `otp` context property to
`true`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  pinInput.machine.withContext({
    otp: true,
  }),
)
```

## Securing the text input

When collecting private or sensitive information using the pin input, you might
need to mask the value entered, similar to `<input type="password"/>`. Pass the
`mask` context property and set it to `true`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  pinInput.machine.withContext({
    mask: true,
  }),
)
```

## Listening for changes

The pin-input machine invokes several callback functions when the user enters:

- `onChange` — Function invoked when the value is changed.
- `onComplete` — Function invoked when all fields have been completed (by typing
  or pasting).
- `onInvalid` — Function invoked when an invalid value is entered into the
  input. An invalid value is any value that doesn't match the specified "type".

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  pinInput.machine.withContext({
    onChange(value) {
      // value => string[]
      console.log("value changed to:", values)
    },
    onComplete(value, valueAsString) {
      // value => string[], valueAsString => string
      console.log("completed value:", values)
    },
    onInvalid(details) {
      // details => { index: number, value: string }
      console.log("invalid value:", details)
    },
  }),
)
```

## RTL support

The pin input machine supports RTL writing directions. To set the `dir` property
in the machine's context.

When this attribute is set, we attach a `dir` attribute to the root part.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  pinInput.machine.withContext({
    dir: "rtl",
  }),
)
```

## Methods and Properties

The pin-input's connect method exposes the following methods:

- `value` — The value of the pin input as an array.
- `valueAsString` — The value of the pin input as string.
- `isValueComplete` — Whether all input's have been filled.
- `setValue()` — Function used to set the a new value of the input.
- `clearValue()` — Function used to clear the values.
- `setValueAtIndex()` — Function used to set value at the specified index.

```jsx
const api = connect(state, send)

api.value
// => ["1", "3", "3"]

api.valueAsString
// => "133"

api.isValueComplete
// => true

api.setValue(["3", "0", "0"])
api.clearValue()

api.setValueAtIndex(1, "2") // sets the value at index 1 to "2"
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each pin-input's part has a `data-part` attribute
added to them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Completed state

When all values have been filled, we attach a `data-complete` attribute to the
root and input parts.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-complete] {
  /* styles for when all value has been filled */
}

[data-part="input"][data-complete] {
  /* styles for when all value has been filled */
}
```

### Invalid state

When an invalid value is entered, we attach a `data-invalid` attribute to the
affected input part.

```css
[data-part="input"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for when the input is invalid */
}
```

### Disabled state

When the pin-input is disabled, we attach a `data-disabled` attribute to the
root and input parts.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for when the input is disabled */
}

[data-part="input"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for when the input is disabled */
}
```
