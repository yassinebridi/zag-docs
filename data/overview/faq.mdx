# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why the need for `normalizeProps`?

The goal of `normalizeProps` is to convert the props of the component into the
format that is compatible with the respective framework.

There are subtle difference between how element attributes are named across
frameworks like React, Solid and Vue. Here are some examples:

**Keydown listener**

- React and Solid: The keydown listener property is `onKeyDown`.
- Vue: The keydown listener property is `onKeydown`.

**Styles**

- React: Pass a numeric value for margin attributes like `{ marginBottom: 4 }`.
- Solid: It has to be `{ "margin-bottom": "4px" }`.
- Vue: You need to ensure the value is a string with unit.
  `{ marginBottom: "4px" }`.

These little nuances between frameworks are handled automatically when you use
`normalizeProps`.

## How do I attach custom extra event handlers to the elements?

Zag encourages the use of spread props to ensure we automatically attach all the
event handlers and properties to elements.

Sometimes, you may want to attach your own event handlers to the elements. To do
that, import the `mergeProps` utility provided by zag for your framework.

```jsx
// 1. import mergeProps utility
import { useMachine, useSetup, mergeProps } from "@zag-js/react"
import * as toggle from "@zag-js/toggle"

export function Toggle() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(toggle.machine)
  const ref = useSetup({ send, id: "1" })
  const api = toggle.connect(state, send)

  // 2. write your custom event handlers
  const handleClick = () => {
    // do something
  }

  // 3. merge the props
  const buttonProps = mergeProps(api.buttonProps, {
    onClick: handleClick,
  })

  return (
    // 4. spread the new props
    <button ref={ref} {...buttonProps}>
      {api.isPressed ? "On" : "Off"}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## What would it take to support other frameworks?

We're currently interested in supporting as many frameworks as possible. The key
requirements are:

- **Support for "spread props"**: The framework should have support for
  spreading attributes and event handlers.

- **Exposed Typings**: The framework should expose the typings for the
  attributes and event handlers. This is optional but would provide the best DX.

## How do I upgrade all zag dependencies?

Since we use independent versioning for each zag package, it can sometimes be
inconvenient to upgrade all dependencies individually.

You can use scoped upgrades feature in your package manager to update all zag
packages seamlessly.

```bash
pnpm up "@zag-js/*"
# or
yarn upgrade --scope @zag-js
# or
npm up @zag-js/...
```
